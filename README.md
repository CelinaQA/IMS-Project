# Inventory Management System (IMS)

This Inventory Management System (IMS) is designed so that an end user can interact with it via a Command-Line Interface (CLI).  A user will be able to store details of customers, items and orders in a database connected to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance, with full CRUD capabilities. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Java and Git Bash installed on your computer to run the IMS.  
  
For Java: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk14-archive-downloads.html  
For Git Bash: https://git-scm.com/download/win



### Installing

To be able to run this project from Git Bash, open Git Bash in an empty folder you want to save the repository in and run the following command:
